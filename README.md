# Fraud Transactions Prediction
Objective : To develop a model for predicting fraudulent transactions for a financial company and use insights from the model to develop an actionable plan. 
Here i have implemented XG BOOST Model with Precision of 99%.
Fraud detection is classified as an imbalanced classification problem. Because of this, weâ€™re not going to get very far using accuracy as an evaluation metric.
That's why Evaluation metrics for this model are Prediction & Recall.
